EDGE is a 100% volunteer-run, non-profit organization that hosts an annual three-day leadership conference that is free of cost to participating students. You can learn more about us at our website: www.edgeyl.org.

Details about this year's EDGE conference can be found in our in information packet: http://www.edgeyl.org/reginfo. We have e-mailed your student with the link to important online registration forms that they'll need to fill out with a parent or guardian to officially confirm their spot at EDGE.
